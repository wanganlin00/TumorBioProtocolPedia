the plain was late and detectives were wait at the airport all morning

they were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from south africa

a few hours earlier,someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds

when plain arrived,,detectives wait inside the main building while others wait on the airfield

two men take the parcel off the plain  and  carried it into customs house

while two detectives keeping guard at the door , two others  opened the parcel 

to their surprise the precious parcel was full of stone and sand




Joe S has the most beautiful garden in our town
nearly everybody enters for The Nicest Garden Competition each year
but joe wins every time
Bill F's garden is larger than Joe 
Bill works hard than joe and grows more flowers and vegetabes
but joe's garden is more interesting than Bill
he has made neat paths and built a wooden bridge over a pool
i like gardens too but i do not like hard work 
Every year i enter for the garden competition too,
and i always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town
