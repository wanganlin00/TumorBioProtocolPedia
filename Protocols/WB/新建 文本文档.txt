KCl	2.7 mM
Tris base	19 mM
Prepare a 20× stock of TBS by combining appropriate amounts of the ingredients listed above. Autoclave and store at room temperature. Prepare a working solution of TBS (1×, pH 7.4) by diluting the 20× stock in Milli-Q water. For TBST, add 1 mL of Tween 20 per liter of TBS. Stir constantly until homogenous.
